bohr.io, along with its affiliates ("bohr.io," "we," "our," and/or "us"), highly values the privacy of individuals who engage with our website and associated services (collectively referred to as "our Services"). 

This privacy policy (referred to as the "Privacy Policy") outlines our practices regarding the collection, utilization, and sharing of information pertaining to you or your device as you make use of the Services. 

By making use of our Services, you signify your consent to the collection, usage, disclosure, and procedures detailed in this Privacy Policy. In the event that you are an entity customer situated in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, you also acknowledge and accept the terms of the Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") accessible at https://bohr.io/site/dpa. If you represent a Local Educational Agency in the United States, you further acknowledge the applicability of our U.S. Student Data Protection Addendum, which is incorporated into this document by reference. Beyond the scope of the Privacy Policy, please be aware that your utilization of our Services is also subject to our Terms of Service.

Information Collection
We gather an array of information from you or your devices through various sources, as explained below.

If you opt not to provide the requested information, you might not have access to some or all of our Services, either due to the necessity of the information for providing the Services or because legal requirements mandate its collection.
A. Data You Furnish to Us
Registration and Profile Details. When you create an account, we request your email address and may ask for your phone number. If you opt for social media account registration, we will also obtain details from those platforms, such as your name, email address, and profile image, following the privacy preferences you've set on those platforms.

Payment Particulars. When you add a credit card or payment method to your account, a third-party payment service provider responsible for processing payments on our behalf will receive and handle your payment card details.

Communications. When you communicate with us, we may receive additional information. For instance, when you interact with our Customer Support Team, we'll collect your name, email address, phone number, the contents of messages or attachments you send us, and other data you choose to share. Subscribing to our newsletter leads to the collection of specific information, such as your email address. We might employ technologies like web beacons in our emails to track open rates, aiming to enhance the customer experience and improve our Services.

Career-Related Information. If you apply for a job, you may submit your contact details and resume online. We'll collect the data you provide in your resume, such as education and employment history. For California-based job applicants, specific additional terms are applicable.
B. Automatic Data Collection During Service Usage

Cookie Clarification: Cookies encompass small files of characters and numbers stored on your browser or computer hard drive, or small graphic elements placed within web pages or emails. They can be temporary for a single browsing session or more enduring. Cookies assist us in collecting data about your browsing actions, differentiating you from other users, offering functionality, and analyzing Service usage. Our third-party partners, including analytics and advertising collaborators, might employ these technologies to collect data about your online activities across services and time. The types of cookies utilized by us and third parties include:

Essential cookies: Some cookies are vital to facilitate Service access. The Services cannot be provided without this cookie category.

Functional cookies: These recognize you upon your return to the Services, allowing us to tailor content for you and remember your preferences, such as language or region choice.

Analytical or Performance cookies: We use cookies for analytics purposes to operate, enhance, and maintain our Services. We may employ our analytics cookies or third-party analytics providers like Google Analytics to gather and process specific analytics data on our behalf. These providers might also collect information about your usage of other websites, applications, and online resources. Opting out of Google Analytics is possible via Google's browser plugin. Further details regarding your rights, choices, and how to block specific cookies can be found in the "Your Rights and Choices" section below.

C. Data Received from Third Parties

If you link our Services to a third-party account, we may acquire data about you, including profile details and photos, as well as information about your usage of the third-party account, as per your settings on that account. To control the information we receive, consult the privacy settings of your third-party accounts.

Other Third-Party Data. We might receive additional information, like demographic data, from third parties such as data or marketing partners, and merge it with our existing information about you.
Utilization of Collected Information
We employ the collected information in the following ways:

To deliver, sustain, refine, and elevate our Services.
To interact with you, furnish updates and additional details pertaining to our Services, provide requested information, address comments and inquiries, and offer customer support.
To streamline the linkage of third-party services or applications, including social networks.

For compliance purposes, which may involve enforcing our Terms of Service or other legal rights, or adhering to applicable laws, regulations, judicial proceedings, or governmental agency requests.
For other explicit purposes that we notify you of at the time the information is gathered.

De-Identified Data: It's important to note that we might transform the information collected from you to a state where it cannot be reasonably traced back to you or your device. Once this de-identification process is executed, we retain the freedom to utilize and share the data for any purpose at our discretion, rendering this Privacy Policy inapplicable to said information.
Your Responsibilities Regarding Privacy
bohr.io offers you the capability to share content that may potentially gather personally identifiable information from its users. Should you choose to share such content, it becomes your duty to comprehend your legal commitments and adhere to all relevant laws, which include:

Furnishing appropriate notifications to your users about their privacy rights, wherein this Privacy Policy should be referenced.
Acquiring any necessary consent from your users for the processing, storage, utilization, and transfer of any personally identifiable information that you collect.
If applicable, supplying requisite notifications and obtaining verifiable parental consent as mandated by the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) or analogous legislations.
Adhering to your legal responsibilities to enable your users to rectify their personally identifiable information or request its deletion.
Legal Grounds for Information Processing

Various global privacy regulations (such as those within the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Brazil) necessitate the establishment of a "legal basis" for the processing of your information. The legal foundations upon which we rely to process your information encompass:

Consent: Your consent has been obtained for the utilization of your information. This applies, for instance, when it's legally required to send you marketing communications.
Contractual Obligation: Your information is essential to furnish you with the Services, such as facilitating registration and addressing your queries.
Adherence to Legal Mandates: We are obligated by law to employ your information, as seen in instances like meeting tax and accounting commitments.
Legitimate Interests: We possess a genuine business interest in utilizing your information, one that doesn't infringe upon your individual rights and concerns. This includes using your information for purposes like product enhancement, internal analytics, refining the accuracy of our machine learning technologies (such as code generation), and enhancing the safety, security, and performance of our Services.
Sharing of Collected Information
We collaborate with the following categories of third parties to share information.
Affiliates: We may share any received information with our affiliated corporate entities under a shared ownership or control framework, for any of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
Service Providers: Information may be shared with vendors engaged in facilitating our Services, who process your data on our behalf. These entities encompass analytics, billing, legal support, marketing, security, machine learning, and fraud prevention entities.
Other Users and Individuals: Our Services foster a social environment where you can discover, cooperate on, and distribute content. Specific portions of your profile, such as your name, user name, profile image, and code, are consistently viewable and searchable by fellow users, while content like your posted code and forum contributions is presented on the Services and accessible by other users by default. The "Your Preferences" segment of this Privacy Policy outlines the controls you can employ to restrict code sharing. We don't assume responsibility for other users' utilization of available information, thus it's important to consider your content choices and self-identification strategy on the Services. It's noteworthy that student profiles created by educators via Teams for Education, as well as students' code, remain inaccessible for public viewing and search, and students cannot post content on publicly accessible forums.
Third-Party App Integrations: If you integrate a third-party application with our Services, information like code may be shared with that third party.
Legal and Comparable Disclosures: We might access, uphold, and reveal your information if there is a genuine belief that such actions are requisite or fitting to: (a) meet requests from law enforcement and legal proceedings, such as court orders or subpoenas; (b) fulfill your requests; or (c) safeguard your rights, our rights, or the rights, property, or safety of others. To be clear, the divulgence of your information may transpire if you share any inappropriate content on or via the Services.
Mergers, Sales, or Asset Transfers: Your information may be disclosed and transferred to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties as part of the assessment, negotiation, or realization of a corporate transaction, wherein we are acquired by or amalgamated with another entity, or when we sell, dissolve, or transfer the entirety or a section of our business or assets.
Consent: We may also reveal information from or about you with your explicit authorization.
Your Rights and Preferences
Customizing Sharing Options: If you wish to restrict the visibility of your code, you have the option to upgrade and designate it as private. Should you import code from GitHub and your repository is public, it will retain its public status by default on bohr.io. Conversely, if you import code from a private GitHub repository, upgrading will ensure that the code remains private on bohr.io as well.

Opting Out of Marketing Communications: You have the ability to unsubscribe from our promotional emails through the provided link within the emails. Even if you choose to opt-out of receiving promotional messages, administrative notifications will continue to be sent to you.

Managing Cookies: Adjusting your browser settings allows you to block, disable, or receive notifications about the receipt of cookies, delete cookies, or navigate our Services utilizing your browser's anonymous usage feature. However, blocking all cookies, including essential ones, via your browser settings could impede your access to specific parts of our Services, or lead to certain functionalities not working as expected.

Your Privacy Rights in Europe: If you're situated in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, the subsequent rights are available to you:

Accessing your Information: You may request access to your maintained information, rectify inaccuracies, restrict or object to processing, anonymize or erase data, as appropriate, and exercise data portability rights.
Withdrawing Consent: You have the right to withdraw any previously granted consent for processing your information, free of charge. This will impact future processing and does not affect the legality of previous processing.
Lodging Complaints: You have the option to file complaints with supervisory authorities, including those in your country of residence, work, or where an incident took place.

To enact these rights, you can contact us using the provided contact information at the conclusion of this Privacy Policy. Prior to addressing your request, we may request reasonable identity verification. It's important to note that each right has specific exceptions and limitations. While any changes you implement will be promptly reflected in active user databases or within a reasonable time frame, we may retain information for backup, archival, fraud prevention, analytics, legal obligations, or legitimate purposes.
Involvement of Third Parties
Our Services may incorporate links to other websites, products, or services that we neither own nor operate. We do not assume responsibility for the privacy practices of these third parties. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your interactions on such third-party platforms or any information you divulge to them. We encourage you to review their privacy policies prior to sharing any data.
Data Retention
We undertake measures to either delete your information or maintain it in a de-identified state when its retention in an identifiable form is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing. This is done unless the law mandates a longer retention period. When determining the specific duration of retention, factors such as the type of service provided, the nature and duration of our relationship, and legal retention mandates are taken into account. When you request the deletion of your account, your data is deleted within 30 days.

Security Measures
We employ an array of technical, organizational, and physical safeguards designed to protect the information we retain. However, given that our Services are electronically hosted, we cannot provide guarantees regarding the security or privacy of your data.
Privacy of Children and Students
Our Services are intended for a general audience and are not targeted at children under 13 years old. By consenting to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, you assert that you are eligible to use our Services in accordance with the age limits prescribed by your country. In the event that we become aware of a user under 13 years old within the United States or under the minimum age requirement in another jurisdiction, we will take reasonable measures to either obtain parental consent or promptly remove the user's personal information from our records. Please contact us at privacy@bohr.io if you believe a user has misrepresented their age in violation of this Privacy Policy.
COPPA Compliance
Under our free Teams for Education offering, verified educators can generate limited bohr.io accounts for students under 13 years old by creating a private invitation link. In such cases, only a username (excluding real names) and persistent identifiers like IP address and cookie data are collected from the account holder. 
FERPA Compliance
FERPA safeguards "personally identifiable information" contained in students' educational records against unauthorized disclosure. In alignment with FERPA, we utilize education records, as defined by FERPA, exclusively for providing agreed-upon services to educational institutions. We share FERPA-protected information solely as directed or permitted by the respective educational entities or under FERPA. When parents or eligible students request access to education records stored on our servers, we assist in facilitating such access. Further insights are available in our U.S. Student Data Protection Addendum and Student Privacy Notice.
