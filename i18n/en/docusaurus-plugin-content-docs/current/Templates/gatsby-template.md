This template comes preconfigured with compilation commands to run locally using [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

After the compilation step, you can view the already published portfolio by accessing the website simulation on the **Overview** screen.

In **Settings**, under "**Authentication**", you can secure the portfolio with a password.

You can also add environment variables in **Environment Variables**.

It's also possible to insert APIs into the template by creating a folder within the **API** folder.
