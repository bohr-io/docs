This is a simple template without a compilation step because it's pure static HTML. If you want to implement an API, it already includes an example.

At this point, this is the only bohr.io template integrated with the **Content Editing** feature. For this feature to work, you must have certain tags in the middle of your HTML code.

You can access the Content Editing feature by clicking **"EDIT"** in the upper right corner of the screen. You can also edit the content directly on the page, and after saving it, the commit will be automatically made to GitHub.
