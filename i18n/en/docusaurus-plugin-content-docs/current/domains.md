In bohr.io, you can add a domain for use within your websites. The first time you add a domain, you will go to the **"Setting the nameservers"** section, with instructions for nameservers configuring in your domain manager.

You can edit the DNS keys once this domain is validated and added to the nameservers. 

You can configure services like receiving emails for this domain in the same area. In **Settings ⇾ General**, selecting an environment (such as the main `branch`), you can edit the URL and use your domain.

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT - 
You cannot use a period (.) before your domain because it belongs to **Tier 1** subdomains. You can only use the hyphen (-) character.
