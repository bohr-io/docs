In bohr.io, you can add a domain for use within your websites. The first time you add a domain, you will go to the **"Setting the nameservers"** section, with instructions on how to configure the nameservers in your domain manager.

Once this domain has been validated and added to the nameservers, you can edit the DNS keys.

In the same area, you can configure services like receiving emails for this domain. In **Settings ⇾ General**, selecting an environment (such as the main `branch`), you can edit the URL and use your domain.

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT - 
You cannot use a period (.) before your domain because it belongs to **Tier 1** subdomains. You can only use the hyphen (-) character.
