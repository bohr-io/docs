# Fair Use Policy

All subscription plans incorporate usage that is subject to this Fair Use Policy. Here is a guideline to help determine which projects fall within our definition of "Fair Use" and which do not.


## Examples of Acceptable Use

- Single-page applications
- Functions that query databases or APIs
- Blogs, e-commerce, and marketing websites


## Examples of Unacceptable Use

- Proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- Hosting media for hot-linking

- Cryptocurrency mining
- Load testing

## Guidelines for Usage

As a guideline for our community, we anticipate that most users will fall within the following usage ranges for each plan. Should your usage deviate significantly, we will contact you to address the outlier usage. Our objective is to be as accommodating as possible while preventing an undue strain on our infrastructure. Whenever possible, we will reach out to you before taking any action to address unreasonable usage and collaborate with you to resolve it.


### Typical Monthly Usage Guidelines

|                                  |                  **Hobby**  |                      **Pro**|
|---------------------------------:|----------------------------:|-----------------------------|
| Bandwidth                        | Up to 100 GB                | Up to 1 TB                  |
| Serverless Function Execution    | Up to 100 GB-Hrs            | Up to 1000 GB-Hrs           |
| Edge Middleware Invocations      | Up to 1,000,000 Invocations | Up to 1,000,000 Invocations |
| Build Execution                  | Up to 100 Hrs               | Up to 400 Hrs               |
| Image Optimization Source Images | Up to 1000 Images           | Up to 5000 Images           |

### Additional recommendations

**CPU Usage Limit for Edge Middleware** - Edge Middleware is advised to utilize an average CPU time of no more than 50ms. This constraint pertains to the actual net CPU time, excluding execution time. For instance, periods waiting for network responses during communication do not contribute to the CPU time restrictions.

### Extra resources availability

For participants in our Pro plan, we introduce a pay-as-you-go structure for supplementary usage, providing enhanced adaptability and management of your consumption. The standard monthly usage benchmarks outlined earlier remain relevant, while any additional usage will be subject to automatic charges according to the following rates:


|                        **Hobby** |                      **Pro**  |
|---------------------------------:|-------------------------------|
| Bandwidth                        | $40 per 100 GB increment      |
| Serverless Function Execution    | $40 per 100 GB-Hrs increment  |
| Edge Middleware Invocations      | $0.65 per 1,000,000 increment |
| Image Optimization Source Images | $5 per 1000 increment         |

## Usage for Profit

Hobby accounts are limited to non-commercial personal use exclusively. Any platform utilization for commercial purposes necessitates a Pro or Enterprise plan.

Commercial usage is any deployment with the intentional generation of financial gains for any entity or individual involved in any aspect of project production. This encompasses paid employees or consultants engaged in code development.  Instances of this include, though are not confined to, the subsequent:

- Any method of soliciting or handling payments from site visitors.
- Promotion of product or service sales.
- Receipt of compensation for site creation, maintenance, or hosting.
- The primary use of affiliate links on the site.
- Incorporation of advertisements, including online advertising platforms like Google AdSense.
- Soliciting donations does not qualify as commercial usage.

If you're unsure if your site qualifies for commercial usage, contact the bohr.io Support team.
