In **Overview ⇾ Project ⇾ Core**, you can access localhost environments (environments running on developers' machines) and view them directly on the screen, thanks to **Cloudflare's Durable Objects**.

To run a localhost, copy the following command:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/bohr-io/app-template.git
cd app-template
npx -y bohr@latest dev
```

As long as the environment variable settings and development commands are correct, the command will run smoothly. If you find any trouble, you can reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/p3hhfGg2Uy).
