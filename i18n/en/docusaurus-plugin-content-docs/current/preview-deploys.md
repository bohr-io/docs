***Preview Deployments*** are all publications not in the production environment, meaning they are not the central publications.

Usually, there are three categories of preview deployments:

- `branches`
- `pull requests`
- `releases`

For now, bohr.io only supports branches. The environments for `pull requests` and `releases` are part of our Roadmap.

The *preview deployments* environment is updated with each new `commit` to the `branch`, creating a preview deployment for each branch.

You can click on "View Website" to directly preview the specific `branch`.

You can also switch between branches by using the selection box available in the navigation bar.
