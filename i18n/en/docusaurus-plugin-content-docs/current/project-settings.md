In the "Settings" screen, the "All Deployments" field defines which settings are at service.

bohr.io settings are based on the publication: it can be a `branch`, a `pull request`, or even a `release`.

For example, if you select the `main` branch, the site's URL will appear, which can be changed.

All menu items, such as environment variables and authentication, are linked to what is selected, whether a `branch` or "All Deployments" (that means all branches will have the same configuration).
