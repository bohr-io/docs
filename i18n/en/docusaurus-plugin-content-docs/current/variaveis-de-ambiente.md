**bohr.io's environment variables** are useful for storing sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, among other examples.

Currently, bohr.io uses some default environment variables, which can be modified in the **Build & Development** menu within your project's settings:

- `BUILD_CMD`
- `DEV_CMD`
- `INSTALL_CMD`
- `DEPLOY_PATH`
- `PUBLIC_PATH`
